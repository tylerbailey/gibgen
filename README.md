**The Basics:**
  
  - You may use *almost any* programming language... it's your choice.  See the supported options [here](http://ideone.com/).
  - Your program should leave the first and last letter of each word in place and scramble the rest.
  - Your program should not scamble punctuation (.,-'...etc.), numbers, or upper-case abbreviations.
  - For example gibberish, see the [/textfiles](https://github.com/sweap/gibgen/tree/master/textfiles) folder.  Two sample output files are provided: `xxx.txt.gib`

**Input/Output:**
 
  - Name your program as follows: `gibgen.xx` (where xx is variable based on the language you choose)
  - Your program should be able to read text input from a string passed into STDIN
      - `gibgen.xx "This is a String"`
      - `cat mystringfile.txt | gibgen.xx`
  - Your program should output to the console.

_Note: This challenge is based on a popular word gibberish meme. You can improve the readability by looking at a [researcher's take](http://www.mrc-cbu.cam.ac.uk/people/matt.davis/cmabridge/) on the truths/myths of this meme, but this is not required._

What to do
----------
1. [Download](http://git-scm.com/downloads) & install Git on your machine

2. <a href="https://github.com/sweap/gibgen/fork" class="btn grouped" data-method="POST" rel="nofollow" title="Fork">Fork</a> this project - Go [here](https://github.com/sweap/gibgen) and click the "Fork" button (located on the upper-right side of the screen)

2. Clone your new fork'd repository to your local machine - `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/gibgen.git`
3. Complete the code challenge and fill out the Quick Start & Questions in the the README (see below)
4. `git add` and `git commit` your local repository as you go
4. Push your code and README back to GitHub occasionally - `git push origin master`
5. Email [serp@ge.com](mailto:serp@ge.com) with the Commit URL to your fork'd repository that you want reviewed. It should include at least 2 files: (1) your updated README with Coding Questions answered, and (2) your program (gibgen.xx)
   - Go here: `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/gibgen/commits/master`
   - Find the commit that you'd like us to review.  _The commit date must be on or before 11:59pm (central) on April 4, 2014!_
       - Click the "Browse Code ->" link for that commit
   - Copy and paste the URL into the email along with your name... it should look something like this:
       - `https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME_HERE/gibgen/tree/73afe0c8fe2...hash.hash...e80afea72b6`

_Note: If you have any questions, email [serp@ge.com](mailto:serp@ge.com).  I will do my best to respond to any questions._

Judging Criteria
----------------

Your responses to the **Coding Questions** at the bottom of this README are the *Most Important* part of this challenge. A working, fully fault-tolerant program that we just can't break, albeit awesome, is the least important.  Why is that?  Remember, we don't expect you to be expert programmers (just yet)... We want to see how you think through a problem.  


For completion by applicant
===========================

Quick Start
-----------

* The program can be run either of the following ways
	filename | java Gibgen
	java Gibgen "my sentence to scramble"
* What programming language did you use? 
	I used Java
* Also tell us anything else the reviewer should know about your code
	Not that I can think of. 
	


Coding Questions
----------------

Question 1: "How did you approach the problem?" (500 words or less)

	My first step in my solution was to read the design specifications carefully and a 
	few times. They left a little to be desired, but I figured they were that way to
	see how we would handle the problem. Besides, nobody ever gets perfect design 
	specifications from a customer. More importantly, the document provided enough to 
	get started. Next, I thought about what exactly would happen when a word would get 
	gib'd. I came to the conclusion that there would need to be at least 4 characters to
	actually do a swap, the two outside and two inner that could be exchanged. 
	I then wrote a method that would do this. After completing it, I started 
	thinking about the basic criteria that would prevent a word from getting and made 
	methods to check those conditions. Once I had the smaller peices of the puzzle, I 
	worked on the reading of strings from stdin or as a arg based on the example in the 
	design specs. Last, I went through the code and did some refactoring and testing of
	methods and the program as a whole. Minor changes were made based on the example 
	gib'd text included in the repo. 
	

Question 2: "What was the most difficult aspect of the solution?" (500 words or less)

	I found thinking about all of the possible cases with a string token to be the most 
	difficult part. For example, what if a token has a period at the end of it, or what if
	a token is an upper case abbreviation but has an apostrophy and an 's' at the end. The
	algorithm for scrambling the words was the easiest part. The examples text files
	proved very helpful for fine tunning the solution. Also deciding if I should account
	for grammatical mistakes was another problem. For example, what if someone used
	ellipses and didn't put a space between them and the preceding word or what if 
	someone didn't put a space after a period ending a sentence.
